# VERLAИ: Automatic Recognition & Standardisation of French Verlan

This repository contains the data, code, and experiments for the project
**Automatic Recognition & Standardisation of French Verlan**, led by Eden Li (University of Otago)
under the supervision of Lech Szymanski and Veronica Liesaputra.

---

## Quick Start

- Create env: `conda env create -f configs/environment.yml && conda activate verlan`
- Train detector: `python -m src.detect.detect_train_lr_bert`
- Detect (batch): `python -m src.detect.detect_infer --infile data/raw/mixed_shuffled.txt --outfile data/predictions/mixed_pred.csv --config configs/detect.yaml`
- Convert (single): `python -m src.convert.convert_infer --text "il a fumé un bédo avec ses rebeus" --config configs/convert.yaml`

### Plot Probability Histogram
- Draw overlapping histograms for Verlan vs Standard probabilities from a predictions CSV.
- Example (produces `docs/results/lr_with_bert_ds_balanced/prob_dist.png`):
  `python src/plot/plot_probability_histogram.py --csv data/predictions/2025-08-29/mixed_shuffled_pred.csv --out docs/results/lr_with_bert_ds_balanced/prob_dist.png`
- Options:
  - `--prob-col` and `--label-col` to override auto-detection
  - `--bins` to set number of bins (default 20)

Notes
- Packaging: `src` is a Python package. Prefer running scripts via `python -m src.<module>`.
- Backward compatibility wrappers exist at `src/detect_infer.py` and `src/convert_infer.py`.

## Detection Pipelines

### LLM + Logistic Regression

Working on the new one!

### Neural Network

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Input text or file] --> B1[Tokenizer]
    A --> B2[UTF-8 byte IDs]
    B1 --> C1[LLM Encoder]
    B2 --> C2[CharCNN]
    C1 --> D[Concatenate]
    C2 --> D
    D --> E[ArcFace Classifier]
    E --> F[Temperature Scaling]
    F --> G{Gazetteer Gate}
    G -- allow --> H[Final prediction: Verlan]
    G -- block --> I[Final prediction: Standard]
```

#### Why does the LLM + LR pipeline perform so well?

- The encoder does the heavy lifting. The Mistral embedding is trained on billions of sentences and already separates verlan and non-verlan contexts in vector space.
- The task is nearly linear. Verlan tokens occupy distinct regions in the embedding space, allowing a simple linear boundary to distinguish them.
- Dictionary gating adds robustness. The lexicon-based post-processing corrects many potential misclassifications from the classifier.
- LR only cuts the final boundary. With rich embeddings and a binary objective, a linear classifier achieves high accuracy with minimal complexity.

## Getting Started

1. Setup environment

```bash
conda env create -f configs/environment.yml
conda activate verlan
```

2. Hugging Face login (for models & datasets)

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

3. Run detector training

```bash
python -m src.detect.detect_train_lr_bert
```

4. Run detector inference

```bash
python -m src.detect.detect_infer \
  --infile data/raw/mixed_shuffled.txt \
  --outfile data/predictions/mixed_pred.csv \
  --config configs/detect.yaml
```

5. Run conversion inference

```bash
python -m src.convert.convert_infer --text "il a fumé un bédo avec ses rebeus" --config configs/convert.yaml
```

6. Visualise embedding space

Plot sentence embeddings in 2‑D and overlay the logistic regression boundary.
Choose the dimensionality reducer (`pca`, `tsne`, or `umap`) and how many
examples to sample. UMAP requires the optional dependency `umap-learn`.

```bash
python -m src.plot.visualize_embeddings --reducer umap --num-points 500 \
  --outfile docs/results/embedding_space_umap.png
```

7. Plot probability distribution (histogram)

```bash
python src/plot/plot_probability_histogram.py \
  --csv data/predictions/2025-08-29/mixed_shuffled_pred.csv \
  --out docs/results/lr_with_bert_ds_balanced/prob_dist.png
```
Options: `--prob-col` and `--label-col` override auto-detection; `--bins` controls bin count.

### Script pairs

- `convert/convert_train.py` ↔ `convert/convert_infer.py`
- `detect/detect_train_lr_bert.py` ↔ `detect/detect_infer.py`

### August 26, 2025 – Reflection after supervisor meeting
- After deeper analysis, discovered that the main issue was not overfitting but a post-processing (gate) induced data leakage bias. The flowchart diagram of the LLM as below + Logistic Regression pipeline clearly illustrates how the Gazetteer Gate can introduce this bias by filtering predictions post-classification which leads to the results as below.

    W[[WARNING: Leakage risk\nTest set mostly lexicon-covered verlan; few OOV/novel forms\nGate hid classifier errors -> deceptively high scores]]
    G -. bias introduced .-> W
  ```

  - Aug 2025: After introducing calibration utilities and threshold optimization (commit fcbfcb0), post-processing separated the classes:
    - Scanned validation thresholds to maximize F1 or Youden's J.
    - Applied temperature scaling to logits so confidence spreads without altering ranking.
    - Used Platt or isotonic calibration to trim the 0.5–0.7 “gray zone” before final thresholding.

    ![Probability Distribution after post-processing](docs/results/only_lr_no_bert_ds_imbalance/prob_dist_post.png)
  
- Recognized the need to optimize the test set by categorizing examples systematically, such as separating existing vs invented verlan, and other relevant categories, to better evaluate model performance.
- Refer to the updated flowchart diagram above and the embedding visualizations linked below for insights into the data distribution and model behavior.
- The embedding visualizations using PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP show distinct clusters of verlan and standard tokens, with UMAP providing clearer separation while t-SNE appears more mixed.
- Noted the limitations of the logistic regression boundary in capturing complex patterns in the embedding space; this motivates plans to experiment with more advanced models.
- Emphasized the importance of rebalancing the dataset to reduce bias and improve generalization.

### August 26, 2025 – Supervisor meeting
- Emphasised balancing the dataset and using cross-validation to avoid overfitting and randomness.
- Acknowledged limitations of the current pipeline (Mistral embeddings + Logistic Regression) and the risk of calibration overfitting.
- Agreed to explore more advanced models (e.g., CamemBERT, mT5, fine-tuned Mistral) and compare their performance.
- Planned to visualise sentence embeddings with t-SNE/UMAP to assess separability of verlan vs. non-verlan examples.
- Highlighted the importance of systematic experimentation and consulting supervisors rather than relying solely on AI tools.
- Action items: balance data, add visualisation, benchmark multiple models, and document the full pipeline for review.


### August 23–25, 2025 – Baseline evaluation and neural network experiments

From August 23 to today (August 25, 2025), the project has progressed as follows:

Baseline classifier established and evaluated: After completing model training on August 23, post-processing steps such as threshold tuning and calibration produced new metrics; however, performance on the validation set was poor, revealing clear overfitting and limited generalization.

Code and experimental environment improvements: Added progress bars, device capability checks, and safeguards for heavy imports to make scripts more stable and user-friendly. Fixed CharCNN pooling kernel size and froze the encoder to reduce GPU memory usage, laying the groundwork for subsequent neural network training.

Initial neural network training: The script detect_train_nn.py has now run for one epoch. First-round results were: AP = 0.3908, ROC-AUC = 0.8135, KS = 0.4990, optimal threshold t* = 0.87 with F1 = 0.2538. These are a feasible start but require more epochs and broader validation to assess whether NN truly outperforms the baseline.

Why train neural networks? Although classical classifiers such as Logistic Regression already achieve reasonably strong results, neural networks offer several advantages: they can automatically learn richer contextual features beyond handcrafted inputs, potentially capturing patterns traditional models overlook; they provide more room for generalization and robustness, especially against the overfitting issues seen in post-processing; and they are more extensible for future directions such as multilingual adaptation, large-scale pretraining, or end-to-end training. Even if they do not immediately surpass the baseline, NNs serve as a valuable benchmark to confirm the ceiling of current approaches and ensure the project remains competitive and future-proof.

### August 23, 2025 – Repository reorganisation
- Moved test files into structured data directories to tidy the repository layout.

### August 12, 2025 – Baseline data and scripts
- Imported raw datasets and annotation resources.
- Added initial `detect.py` and `convert.py` scripts along with environment setup and evaluation utilities.
- Introduced test corpora and baseline predictions to enable early experimentation.

### July 11, 2025 – Initial repository setup
- Created the project skeleton and added the license.
